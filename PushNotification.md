It sounds like you're working with **push notifications** in an iOS app and need help with implementing or modifying the `AppDelegate`'s `userNotificationCenter` methods. Here's a quick breakdown with sample code to help:

### Step 1: Conform to `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate`

In your `AppDelegate.swift`, make sure it conforms to `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate`.

```
swift
CopyEdit

`import UIKit
import UserNotifications

@UIApplicationMainclassAppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate, UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate {
    // Your code...
}
`

```

### Step 2: Request Notification Permission

You usually do this in `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`:

```
swift
CopyEdit

`funcapplication(_application: UIApplication,
                 didFinishLaunchingWithOptionslaunchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

    UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate =selflet options: UNAuthorizationOptions= [.alert, .sound, .badge]
    UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization(options: options) { granted, error iniflet error = error {
            print("Notification authorization error: \(error)")
        }
    }

    application.registerForRemoteNotifications()
    returntrue
}
`

```

### Step 3: Handle Notification Delivery and Interaction

Implement these two methods:

```
swift
CopyEdit

`// Called when a notification is delivered while the app is in the foregroundfuncuserNotificationCenter(_center: UNUserNotificationCenter,
                            willPresentnotification: UNNotification,
                            withCompletionHandlercompletionHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationPresentationOptions) -> Void) {
    completionHandler([.banner, .sound, .badge])
}

// Called when the user taps on the notificationfuncuserNotificationCenter(_center: UNUserNotificationCenter,
                            didReceiveresponse: UNNotificationResponse,
                            withCompletionHandlercompletionHandler: @escaping () -> Void) {
    let userInfo = response.notification.request.content.userInfo
    // Handle the payloadprint("User tapped notification with info: \(userInfo)")
    completionHandler()
}
`

```

Let me know if you need this for a specific case like **React Native**, **FCM**, or **background/foreground handling**, and I'll tailor it for you.

##### You said:

completionHandler(\\\[.banner, .sound, .badge\\\])

what does this mean

###### ChatGPT said:

Great question!

The line:

```
swift
CopyEdit

`completionHandler([.banner, .sound, .badge])
`

```

comes from this method:

```
swift
CopyEdit

`funcuserNotificationCenter(_center: UNUserNotificationCenter,
                            willPresentnotification: UNNotification,
                            withCompletionHandlercompletionHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationPresentationOptions) -> Void)
`

```

### ðŸ§  What it means:

When a **push notification** is received **while the app is in the foreground**, iOS will **not** show it by default (i.e., no banner, no sound, no badge update). This method gives **you** the chance to decide **how** it should be presented.

The line:

```
swift
CopyEdit

`completionHandler([.banner, .sound, .badge])
`

```

is you telling iOS:

> "Yes, even though the app is open, still show the notification as a banner, play the sound, and update the badge count."

### ðŸŽ¯ Options you can pass:

-   `.banner` â†’ show a banner at the top of the screen

-   `.sound` â†’ play the notification sound

-   `.badge` â†’ update the app icon badge count

-   `.list` (iOS 14+) â†’ show in the Notification Center list

You can mix and match depending on what you want:

```
swift
CopyEdit

`completionHandler([.sound]) // Only play sound, no banner or badge
completionHandler([])       // Do nothing (i.e., silent notification)`

```

Let me know your use case---e.g. if you want to suppress banners, just play sound, or something custom---I can help you tweak it.
