# do i need to add index in big query table to get a faster query speed?

No, you do not need to add traditional indexes in BigQuery. BigQuery is a columnar, distributed data warehouse that automatically optimizes query performance through its architecture. It handles data storage and retrieval differently from traditional relational databases.

For Faster Query Performance:
Partitioning: Use partitioned tables to reduce the amount of data scanned during queries.
Clustering: Apply clustering on frequently filtered or joined columns to improve performance.
Denormalization: Flatten your data where possible to reduce complex joins.
Materialized Views: Use materialized views for pre-aggregated data.
Query Optimization: Optimize SQL queries with proper filtering, avoiding SELECT *, and using approximate aggregation functions like APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT.
Let me know if you need help implementing any of these strategies.
