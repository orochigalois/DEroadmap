### 2025-02-06 22:07:45 Could you please explain the high-level architecture of BigQuery?
BigQuery is a data warehousing tool designed for analytical purposes. It has a ***separation of storage and compute***, meaning they operate independently. BigQuery uses ***columnar storage*** (OLAP) instead of traditional row-based (OLTP) storage. This enables efficient querying because it ***scans only the specific columns needed***, improving performance.
_______________________________________________________________
### 2025-02-06 22:12:05 Do i need to add index in big query table to get a faster query speed?
No, you do not need to add traditional indexes in BigQuery. BigQuery is a columnar, distributed data warehouse that automatically optimizes query performance through its architecture. It handles data storage and retrieval differently from traditional relational databases.

For Faster Query Performance:
Partitioning: Use partitioned tables to reduce the amount of data scanned during queries.
Clustering: Apply clustering on frequently filtered or joined columns to improve performance.
Denormalization: Flatten your data where possible to reduce complex joins.
Materialized Views: Use materialized views for pre-aggregated data.
Query Optimization: Optimize SQL queries with proper filtering, avoiding SELECT *, and using approximate aggregation functions like APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT.

*WHERE Clause:*

Purpose: Filters rows before any grouping or aggregation occurs.
Used with: Regular columns (not aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), etc.).

*HAVING Clause:*

Purpose: Filters groups after aggregation (GROUP BY) has been applied.
Used with: Aggregate functions (COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), etc.).

SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;

### 2025-02-09 18:16:56 What are Slots in BigQuery?
reference: xxxxx

A slot in Google BigQuery is a unit of computational capacity that BigQuery uses to process queries.

**🔹 1️⃣ How Slots Work**
-------------------------

-   Each query **consumes slots** based on its complexity.
-   Queries run in parallel using available slots.
-   **More slots → Faster queries**, but at a higher cost.

**🔹 2️⃣ Types of Slot Allocation in BigQuery**
-----------------------------------------------

BigQuery offers **two main slot allocation modes**:

| Mode | Description | Pricing |
| --- |  --- |  --- |
| **On-Demand Pricing (Default)** | BigQuery automatically assigns slots based on query demand. | Pay **per TB scanned** (e.g., `$5 per TB`). |
| --- |  --- |  --- |
| **Capacity-Based (Slot Reservation)** | You purchase **dedicated slots** for predictable performance. | Fixed cost (e.g., **500 slots** at **$10,000/month**). |

**🔹 3️⃣ Understanding Slot Reservation**
-----------------------------------------

Slot reservation allows you to **buy and allocate slots** to control query performance.

### **Example: Buying Slots**

If your queries are **slow due to high demand**, you can reserve slots:

```
sh
CopyEdit

`bq mk --reservation --project_id=my_project --slots=500 my_reservation
`

```

📌 **This reserves 500 slots for your queries.**

### **Assigning Slots to a Query**

You can force a query to use a specific reservation:

```
sql
CopyEdit

`SELECT * FROM my_dataset.my_table
OPTIONS (resource_group='my_reservation');
`

```

* * * *

**🔹 4️⃣ How Many Slots Does a Query Use?**
-------------------------------------------

-   **Simple queries** (e.g., small `SELECT`) → Use **few slots**.
-   **Complex joins, aggregations, large data scans** → Use **many slots**.

📌 **To check slot usage in BigQuery UI:**

1.  Run a query.
2.  Go to **Query Execution Details** → **Performance** → **Slot Usage**.

* * * *

**🔹 5️⃣ Slot Pricing & Cost Optimization**
-------------------------------------------

| Approach | Cost | When to Use? |
| --- |  --- |  --- |
| **On-Demand (Default)** | Pay per **TB scanned** | For low or unpredictable query workloads. |
| --- |  --- |  --- |
| **Flex Slots** | **Short-term (per second) slot purchase** | For **temporary high demand** (cheaper than on-demand for heavy queries). |
| **Flat-Rate Slots** | Fixed cost per month | For **consistent, high-volume workloads**. |

* * * *

**🔹 6️⃣ Best Practices for Slot Optimization**
-----------------------------------------------

✔ **Use partitions & clustering** to reduce slot consumption.
✔ **Limit `ORDER BY`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY` on large datasets.**
✔ **Precompute & cache results** to reduce slot usage.
✔ **Monitor slot usage in BigQuery UI** → Identify **slow queries**.
✔ **Consider Flex Slots for cost savings** if running heavy queries.

### 2025-02-09 20:13:50 Difference Between a Normal View and a Materialized View in BigQuery
reference: xxxxx

**🔹 1️⃣ Normal View (Standard View)**
--------------------------------------

A **normal view** in BigQuery is a **logical layer** that stores **only the query definition**, not the data. Every time you query a normal view, **BigQuery re-runs the underlying query**.

### **📌 Example: Creating a Normal View**

```
sql
CopyEdit

`CREATE VIEW my_dataset.customer_view AS
SELECT customer_id, name, total_spent
FROM my_dataset.customers
WHERE total_spent > 100;
`

```

📌 **Key Characteristics of Normal Views**

-   **💾 Storage:** **No additional storage** (only metadata is stored).
-   **⚡ Performance:** **Slower** because the underlying query runs every time.
-   **💲 Cost:** **Higher cost** as you pay for scanning the base table every time.
-   **🔄 Freshness:** **Always up to date** (real-time).
-   **⚙️ Indexing & Partitioning:** **Not supported.**

* * * *

**🔹 2️⃣ Materialized View**
----------------------------

A **materialized view (MV)** stores **the query results as precomputed data**.
Instead of recomputing the query every time, **BigQuery reads the precomputed results**, making queries much **faster and cheaper**.

### **📌 Example: Creating a Materialized View**

```
sql
CopyEdit

`CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW my_dataset.mv_customer_summary AS
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS order_count, SUM(total_spent) AS total_spent
FROM my_dataset.orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
`

```

📌 **Key Characteristics of Materialized Views**

-   **💾 Storage:** Stores **precomputed** query results (takes up space).
-   **⚡ Performance:** **Faster queries** (precomputed results reduce processing time).
-   **💲 Cost:** **Lower cost** (reads from the MV instead of scanning the whole table).
-   **🔄 Freshness:** **Not real-time** (MV updates automatically but on a schedule).
-   **⚙️ Indexing & Partitioning:** **Supports clustering and partitioning**.

### 2025-02-09 21:06:02 why APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT can speed up query?
reference: xxxxx

In BigQuery, `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT` is a **faster alternative** to `COUNT(DISTINCT column)`, and it speeds up queries because:

1.  **✅ Uses Approximate Algorithms (HyperLogLog++)**

    -   Instead of **scanning the entire dataset**, BigQuery uses **probabilistic counting** (HyperLogLog++) to estimate the distinct count.
    -   This reduces **CPU usage** and **memory consumption**.
2.  **✅ Avoids Expensive Sorting & Deduplication**

    -   `COUNT(DISTINCT column)` requires:
        -   **Sorting the data** (which is expensive for large tables).
        -   **Deduplication** (which increases processing time).
    -   `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(column)` **does not require sorting**, making it much **faster**.
3.  **✅ Works in Streaming & Partitioned Queries**

    -   **`COUNT(DISTINCT)` is slow** in **streaming** or **partitioned queries** because it needs **global deduplication**.
    -   `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT` works **efficiently** even in **distributed queries**.
4.  **✅ Uses Less Memory & Compute Resources**

    -   **`COUNT(DISTINCT)` stores every unique value**, increasing **RAM usage**.
    -   **`APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT` stores only a compressed hash of values**, reducing memory needs.

* * * *

### **📌 Performance Comparison**

#### **1️⃣ Normal `COUNT(DISTINCT)`**

```
sql
CopyEdit

`SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)
FROM my_dataset.events;
`

```

-   **Slower** for large tables (due to sorting & deduplication).
-   **Expensive** in terms of processing costs.

#### **2️⃣ Faster `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT`**

```
sql
CopyEdit

`SELECT APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(user_id)
FROM my_dataset.events;
`

```

-   **5-50x faster** 🚀.
-   **Slight margin of error (~0.1% - 0.5%)**, but much **cheaper**.

* * * *

### **💡 When to Use `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT`?**

| **Use Case** | **Recommended Function** |
| --- |  --- |
| ✅ Need **100% accuracy** | `COUNT(DISTINCT column)` |
| --- |  --- |
| ✅ Need **fast & cheap** results (minor inaccuracy is okay) | `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(column)` |
| ✅ Working with **large datasets** | `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(column)` |
| ✅ Need **real-time analytics** | `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(column)` |
