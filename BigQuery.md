### 2025-02-06 22:07:45 Could you please explain the high-level architecture of BigQuery?
BigQuery is a data warehousing tool designed for analytical purposes. It has a ***separation of storage and compute***, meaning they operate independently. BigQuery uses ***columnar storage*** (OLAP) instead of traditional row-based (OLTP) storage. This enables efficient querying because it ***scans only the specific columns needed***, improving performance.

### 2025-02-06 22:12:05 Do i need to add index in big query table to get a faster query speed?
No, you do not need to add traditional indexes in BigQuery. BigQuery is a columnar, distributed data warehouse that automatically optimizes query performance through its architecture. It handles data storage and retrieval differently from traditional relational databases.

For Faster Query Performance:
Partitioning: Use partitioned tables to reduce the amount of data scanned during queries.
Clustering: Apply clustering on frequently filtered or joined columns to improve performance.
Denormalization: Flatten your data where possible to reduce complex joins.
Materialized Views: Use materialized views for pre-aggregated data.
Query Optimization: Optimize SQL queries with proper filtering, avoiding SELECT *, and using approximate aggregation functions like APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT.

*WHERE Clause:*

Purpose: Filters rows before any grouping or aggregation occurs.
Used with: Regular columns (not aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), etc.).

*HAVING Clause:*

Purpose: Filters groups after aggregation (GROUP BY) has been applied.
Used with: Aggregate functions (COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), etc.).

SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
